# LAB 5

This lab covered implementing stubs in the grades application in order to test the method for the grade calculation. 
The way these stubs were implemented is in the GradesTest file, allowing the test cases to not call the actual methods
in order to test the methods. For the Twitter application, we implemented mocks and in order to test the Twitter class and 
see if the mocks can handle null exceptions, determine if certain strings are mentioned in the tweets.
