This project is designed to use JaCoCo to see the statement and branch coverage of the code. Through using JaCoCo we are able to determine the statement and branch coverage of the class Data.java and using this data we are able to develop different Test Case's to increase the statement and branch coverage. I have developed the test cases tc21-tc38. Which had increased the statement coverage to 100% and branch coverage to 95% with 3 branches missing.
