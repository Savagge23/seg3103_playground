# seg3103_playground
This project is designed to use JaCoCo to see the statement and branch coverage of the code. Through using JaCoCo we are able to determine the statement and branch coverage of the class Data.java and using this data we are able to develop different Test Case's to increase the statement and branch coverage. I have developed the test cases tc21-tc38. Which had increased the statement coverage to 100% and branch coverage to 98% with only one missing branch condition to achieve 100%. I wasn't able to see how I culd further refractor the code. Also screenshots are also shown for the JaCoCo results before and after the implementations of the test cases.
